`What is chat bot?`

[dictionary] : a computer program designed to simulate converstion with human users, especially over the internet.

Chat bot is low entry barrier and has alot of availability.

He recommand to unadvisable to use Chat bot Tool. Beacuse, it is not easy  when we want to add more detail function.

so, We have to work coding.
Every chat bot platform based to Pizza delivery service beacuase, it is easy to make.

Pizza delivery chat bot service is so simple and easy to develop also, an undemanding work. It is looks like a 'Hello world' of Chat bot.

Before, we make a chat bot service. we have to consider about chat bot service level which is must  optimizing product. It measn that Don't expected too much. First of all make simple.

`Chat bot used technique`

These technics are already made to service. so, if you want to put in your project, You can use the service.

1. Pattern Recognition : number, text, voice, picture can be a pattern. (for example): when you take a picture to your face, face in picture can be a pattern.

2. Natural Language Processing : This is very important things. (for example): when you want to order to chinese restaurant by phone. you can feel like conversation with person. It feels like similar to do the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

3. Text Mining : When you ordered something, you will text on phone or pc whatelse. You might make typing error. but, Text mining technic will help you to find a correct word. (for example) If you write wrong word  when you ordered, Text mining technic will find in antonym. It will give to you correct word. order will be success.

these technics are very useful and based on deep learning. deep learning is kinds of machine learning. But, We can't have to consider about deep learning. we just use the service including these technics. These technics also have a Korean version. so, we can easy to use.

`Make a Chatbot`

★ This lecture will use the Microsoftware Chatbot Framework

Chat bot is a Web programming. beacuse, When messinger will send a message to web server. web server will proccessing about message. so, Web support program can make a chat bot. But, We have to think about between coding or just use framework.

★ Microsoftware Bot Frame work is made up two languages : C#, node.js

★ Microsoftware Bot Frame work support :

  ● Skype

  ● email - only office365 mail

  ● shopping mall web chat service

  ● Facebook

  ● Kik

  ● Slack

  ● Telegram

  ● Twilio - This is Grobal company, they can surpport to text and every mobile phone in the world.

  ● direct line app integration - Cacao talk, Line ..etc , these will connect to rest chennel.

Each messinger service is different and update also. so, web server have to change to process messinger service by messinger service. so, Microsoftware solve this problem.

{% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
<img src="https://paypulse.github.io/assets/images/Connector.png" width="400" height="211"/>  
{% endfor %}

Fortunately, Connector fee is free. so, we just register our web server url to connector. Connector will help you to process about which messinger chennel. so, if Messinger program will change, it is not a big deal.

But, Web service sould only https. beacuse,privacy security problem. if you want to http,you coudln't use a cloud service.

◆ Think about web service.

if you want to maintenance of state , what did you do?
we use cookie but, chat bot can't put in cookie so, connector service will be help this.

so, connector has many ID. channel ID, conversation ID, user ID. these ID will help to maintenance of state.

`Developing setting`
1. Visual Studio 2015 or higher
2. Visual Studio Bot Project Template //[lecture GitHub][jekyll-material]

  - Don't release compression

  - File dicrectory: C:\Users\beaut\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#

  - if you can't find C# folder, you can make yourself.


3. Bot Emulator //[lecture GitHub][jekyll-material]

  - [windows] : botframework-emulator-Setup-3.5.31.exe

  - [mac] : botframework-emulator-3.5.31-mac.zip //for node.js user

`Make a Chatbot project!!`
1. open visual studio2017
2. File -> new -> project -> visual studio C# -> bot application
3. You can find a error : this means that some library or package on web server. so, you have to solution build then every library or package will download.

◈ Web.config  : basic setting control

◈ Dialogs     : put in your conversation dialog.

RootDialog.cs  : Basically, first perform this cs file.

---
`RootDialog.cs`

{% highlight ruby %}
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs;
using Microsoft.Bot.Connector;

namespace GreatWall.Dialogs
{
    [Serializable]
    public class RootDialog : IDialog<object>
    {
      //first, this method implement.
        public Task StartAsync(IDialogContext context)
        {
          //call MessageReceivedAsync!!
          //Wait method : wait to users input.
            context.Wait(MessageReceivedAsync);

            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        private async Task MessageReceivedAsync(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<object> result)
        {
            /*activity : user's every action.*/

            var activity = await result as Activity;

            /*calculate something for us to return
            if) user types "Hello" then, activity.Text  means "Hello".*/

            int length = (activity.Text ?? string.Empty).Length;

            /*return our reply to the user
             push to user's messinger.
             this example is echo bot.
             if you write on your messiner "Hello",
             this chat bot will send to your text.*/

            await context.PostAsync($ " You sent {activity.Text} which was {length} characters " );
            context.Wait(MessageReceivedAsync);

        }
    }
}

`Let's do it Run`

１. press F5

２. As i said to you, this is Web coding. so, it will
give to you web browser.

{% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
<img src="https://paypulse.github.io/assets/images/result1.png" width="838" height="417"/>  
{% endfor %}

３. You can find out IIS web server icon on your windows right down screen. visual studio include IIS express web server. so, this IIS web server help this project result. that's reason why this project can return to web browser.

４. Now, It's time to use a Bot Emulator. !!

{% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
<img src="https://paypulse.github.io/assets/images/emulator1.png" width="838" height="417"/>  
{% endfor %}

５. press Connect button
You can find out 200 number then, it works successfully.

I will ask them beacause, they said to me it only works on https but, My new example sample works on http. so, I need answer "Why".

６. press POST link in emulator

{% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
<img src="https://paypulse.github.io/assets/images/jsonfile.png" width="539" height="921"/>  
{% endfor %}

It means that every conversation information send and receive to json file.

７. If you want to code editing, you would shut down project run.

８. Emulator is little bit slow, so if you want to more quickly see result, just turn on while your code editing.

`example 01 : erasing echo conversation`

{% highlight ruby %}
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs;
using Microsoft.Bot.Connector;

namespace GreatWall.Dialogs
{
    [Serializable]
    public class RootDialog : IDialog<object>
    {
        public Task StartAsync(IDialogContext context)
        {
            context.Wait(MessageReceivedAsync);

            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        private async Task MessageReceivedAsync(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<object> result)
        {
            var activity = await result as Activity;

            string message = string.Format("{0}을 주문 하셨습니다. 감사합니다." ,activity.Text);

            // return our reply to the user
            await context.PostAsync(message);

            context.Wait(MessageReceivedAsync);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

１. Before find out the result, Press the New Conversation button in Emulator.

`example 02 : Hi function01`

1. [Serializable] : Every class will output as a json file in chatbot frameworks. so, that's reason why we must declare to Serialization.

2. IDialog<object> : When we make a dialog, we need to inherit from IDialog interface. when we inherit from IDialog, we must make a "public Task StartAsync(IDialogContext context)" method. if you forget put in this method, you will get error.

3. public Task StartAsync(IDialogContext context) : This Method part is a dialog start point to Chat bot.

            //context.Call(new NameDialog(),this.NameDialogResumeAfter);
            //Recursive call, so we need to exit point.
