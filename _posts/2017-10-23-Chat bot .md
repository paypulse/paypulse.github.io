Chat bot is low entry barrier and has alot of availability.

He recommand to unadvisable to use Chat bot Tool. Beacuse, it is not easy  when we want to add more detail function.

`Chat bot used technique`

These technics are already made to service. so, if you want to put in your project, You can use the service.

1. Pattern Recognition : number, text, voice, picture can be a pattern. (for example): when you take a picture to your face, face in picture can be a pattern.

2. Natural Language Processing : This is very important things. (for example): when you want to order to chinese restaurant by phone. you can feel like conversation with person. It feels like similar to do the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

3. Text Mining : When you ordered something, you will text on phone or pc whatelse. You might make typing error. but, Text mining technic will help you to find a correct word. (for example) If you write wrong word  when you ordered, Text mining technic will find in antonym. It will give to you correct word. order will be success.

these technics are very useful and based on deep learning. deep learning is kinds of machine learning. But, We can't have to consider about deep learning. we just use the service including these technics. These technics also have a Korean version. so, we can easy to use.

`Make a Chatbot`

★ This lecture will use the Microsoftware Chatbot Framework

Chat bot is a Web programming. beacuse, When messinger will send a message to web server. web server will proccessing about message. so, Web support program can make a chat bot. But, We have to think about between coding or just use framework.

★ Microsoftware Bot Frame work is made up two languages : C#, node.js

★ Microsoftware Bot Frame work support :

  ● Skype

  ● email - only office365 mail

  ● shopping mall web chat service

  ● Facebook

  ● Kik

  ● Slack

  ● Telegram

  ● Twilio - This is Grobal company, they can surpport to text and every mobile phone in the world.

  ● direct line app integration - Cacao talk, Line ..etc , these will connect to rest chennel.

Each messinger service is different and update also. so, web server have to change to process messinger service by messinger service. so, Microsoftware solve this problem.

{% endfor %}

Fortunately, Connector fee is free. so, we just register our web server url to connector. Connector will help you to process about which messinger chennel. so, if Messinger program will change, it is not a big deal.

But, Web service sould only https. beacuse,privacy security problem. if you want to http,you coudln't use a cloud service.

◆ Think about web service.

if you want to maintenance of state , what did you do?
we use cookie but, chat bot can't put in cookie so, connector service will be help this.

so, connector has many ID. channel ID, conversation ID, user ID. these ID will help to maintenance of state.
