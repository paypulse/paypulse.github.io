`C# programming`

I realize that i must change to study style.
sometimes, I only study book everyday and even month.
but it is not finished and boring and sometimes i felt period is over.
so, I decide to change posting style.

I will write about purpose on every posting.
1. Why i made this posting? It will be a purpose of posting.
2. Where will this posting and code help us?
3. Example source
4. source of code
5. result of example. --> this will be a animation things.

I am really excited to make this posting.
I need to passion for code before posting . when many people see my blog, They have to get some kinds of impact.

The only way is crazy efforts, this is will give to me a better life and find a self-realization.

I am not a pretty but I can be a seductive woman. Having a competitive to ability , passion and vision.
