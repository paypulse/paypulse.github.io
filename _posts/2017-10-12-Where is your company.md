I got a Huge dilemma.
We will have to move to another places.
Actually, Pay-Pulse need to company address. so, I must move few days later.
As you know, Most start-up company has no money when we start to make a company.

I do a lot of things like a programming and editing image, a lot of paper work and personal problem.
I fight for every thing. Just go or not?
I will be a 30 years old but, My pay-pulse is just few month old.

Just go back to work to other company or just keep going on it.
Many company owner must think about this issue. I can guess.
